Hand Talk: Plains Indian Sign Language (Toki Pona Edition)

This is a deck copied from a Toki Pona Learning deck, but changed to include Plains Indian Handtalk. I did this so that I could learn Plains Handtalk while practicing Toki Pona at the same time, as I felt that if I could use Plains talk with Toki Pona syntax, I could get a headstart in communicating Indian Sign Language before moving onto the rest of Plains Indian Signs.

The philosophy of this deck is, “if I can memorize a Toki Pona word alongside a HandTalk sign, then I’ve mastered both.”

Because many Sign Language gestures typically encompass multiple meanings, I’ve found that Toki Pona’s small vocabulary can be used pretty well as a foundation for communicating any sort of sign language with the minimum amount of gestures.

Here's a video describing the history of Plains HandTalk: https://youtu.be/s1-StAlw3aE

HandTalk can be considered an instance of one of the first Universal languages of the world, as it was used across many Plains indian tribes to communicate passed tribal language barriers. There's an effort to keep Plains Hand Talk alive, to preserve it as less and less people use it actively. While recognized tribes teach it, I'm hoping this deck will pique people's interest in the language.

Disclaimer: This isn’t meant to be a substitute to learning more handtalk, or a simplified/butchered form of sign language. This deck is to provide the bare minimum vocabulary needed to form complete sentences and conversations in Plains Indian Sign Language. Similar to the concept of “you only need to know 1,000 words to speak a new language”, the idea here is to learn the minimum words necessary in order to talk in PISL.

While the cards largely encompass word-per-word translations of Toki Pona into Plains Sign Language, antonyms and synonyms are also often added as extra notes to expand on Hand Talk inclusion. It is estimated that you only need to know 200 signs to speak fluently in Plains Indian HandTalk, which I’ve aimed to include into this deck.
